                    <p class="about-us__text frontpage__article-summary">The Papernugget news site was made with pure HTML5 and CSS. The styling is stored in separate files from the markup for easier readability and editing.</p>
                    <p class="about-us__text frontpage__article-summary">Papernugget was made responsive using media queries, flexbox and percentage values for widths and heights in combination with properties such as max-width. We have made sure to label all images and links properly so people visiting the site with screen readers can use it just as well as others. There are no combination of red or green colors so that red-green colorblind people can use the site as normal. Font sizes are large, so people with eyesight issues should still be able to use Papernugget as their daily news provider.</p>
                    <p class="about-us__text frontpage__article-summary">All of the articles on Papernugget were made up and written by me, Elliot Duchek, to avoid copyright issues. The images on Papernugget are all taken from Unsplash, a site where you can pick and use images freely. This was also done to avoid copyright issues.</p>
                    <p class="about-us__text frontpage__article-summary">I have allowed Marcus Billman, the creator of Merrystory, to use one of my articles since he has trouble writing his own and also doesn't want to have to deal with copyright claims.</p>
