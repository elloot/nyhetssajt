                    <p class="frontpage__article-summary"><span class="article__preamble bold">A tiny 9-month-old Golden Retriever and his owner Monika just arrived by train in Umeå. Apparently, they’re here to relax and eat tasty food during the weekend, or at least that’s what they hoped.</span></p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary">Chester, the golden Retriever, and Monika got off the train heading for Umeå at 10 pm yesterday. Coming from Skellefteå, Monika says that the change in scenery and atmosphere is highly appreciated.</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary article__quote">"Chester and I have been getting quite bored of good old Skellefteå recently so visiting Umeå for the weekend will be very nice!"</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary"><span class="italic">And how is Chester handling the trip?</span></p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary article__quote">"Oh, he’s having the time of his life! Everybody here is super friendly and he’s getting petted constantly. Maybe a little too much but it’s okay."</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary"><span class="italic">What do you mean by that?</span></p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary article__quote">"Well you know, we came down here to relax and the attention has been getting a little too draining for him, he’s fallen asleep twice already today. I think he likes it though, he seems even happier than normal, if that’s at all possible."</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary">Chester was born in March 2019 in Sundsvall, Sweden. Monika picked him up a month later and they’ve been living together ever since. Monika was looking for something to brighten up her sometimes-gloomy days after work and Chester was the perfect solution.</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary article__quote">"I’m a full-time teacher so sometimes the workdays can be really hard on you. Now-adays though, having Chester to greet me when I come home is simple amazing, he’s such a little spark of joy!"</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary">Currently, Monika and Chester are staying at Scandic Hotel here in Umeå, mostly because they allow dogs there. However, Chester has apparently really been enjoying the dog-breakfast they serve. Consisting of bacon, fibre-rich bread and a special dog-cake whose ingredients are secret. The dog cake especially was Chester’s favourite yesterday says Monika.</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary article__quote">"He really liked the bacon and bread but the cake was definitely his favourite, I don’t think he’ll ever eat anything tastier! You should have seen him when he took the first – and only – bite, his face completely lit up! Scandic has been treating us really well."</p>

                    <p class="article__text frontpage__article-summary">But now Monika and Chester have to hurry off, apparently there are more people who want to meet and pet Chester! We here at Papernugget certainly wish him well and hope that he will get many bellyrubs.</p>
